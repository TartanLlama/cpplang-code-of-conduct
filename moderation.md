CppLang Slack Moderation Guidelines
===================================

Introduction
------------

It is important that all usersâ€™ questions, answers and comments are in line with the [CppLang Slack Code of Conduct](/), as well as with the category and topic, or channel, they belong to. When deciding to approach a user, moderators and administrators must always assume intentions are good, which is usually the case. Over-moderation is harmful to the atmosphere of the community and should be avoided.

Expectations for moderator enforcement
--------------------------------------

While in practice most actions from moderators and administrators will be friendly reminders, they should act on complaints/reports quickly and involve other team members if necessary. They should take appropriate, usually private, action if they see any abuse or harassment. They must be sensitive to cultural differences, time zones, etc., but take prompt action when necessary. A moderator is one who exists to serve the community.

Suggested strategies for moderators when dealing with observed violations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except in the most egregious cases, moderators will follow these guidelines:

- First, attempt to privately message the user and point out to them that their behavior violates our Code of Conduct. Include a link to the Code of Conduct in that message.
- If the user does not respond to a request, escalate to the private #admins channel to discuss the incident with fellow community moderators.
- Once the issue has been discussed with the fellow community moderators, decide if further steps need to be taken.

In those cases of obvious, flagrant violations, moderators will remove the post immediately, and bring the issue to the attention of the private #admins channel.
